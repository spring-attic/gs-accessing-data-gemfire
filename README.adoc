This guide walks you through the process of building an application the https://geode.apache.org/[{apache-geode-name}]
data management system.

== What You Will build

You will use https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-geode[Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}]
to store and retrieve POJOs.

== Starting with Spring Initializr

For all Spring applications, you should start with the https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr]. Spring Initializr
offers a fast way to pull in all the dependencies you need for an application and does a lot of the set up for you.
This example needs Spring for Apache Geode dependency.

You can use this https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=2.5.5&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=11&groupId=com.example&artifactId=accessing-data-gemfire&name=accessing-data-gemfire&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot&packageName=com.example.accessing-data-gemfire&dependencies=geode[pre-initialized project] and click Generate to download a ZIP file. This project is configured to fit the examples in this tutorial.

To manually initialize the project:

. In a web browser, navigate to https://start.spring.io.
This service pulls in all the dependencies you need for an application and does most of the setup for you.
. Choose either Gradle or Maven and the language you want to use. This guide assumes that you chose Java.
. Click *Dependencies* and select *Spring for Apache Geode*.
. Click *Generate*.
. Download the resulting ZIP file, which is an archive of a web application that is configured with your choices.

NOTE: If your IDE has the Spring Initializr integration, you can complete this process from your IDE.

NOTE: You can also fork the project from Github and open it in your IDE or other editor.

== Define a Simple Entity

{apache-geode-name} is an In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG) that maps data to regions. You can configure
distributed regions that partition and replicate data across multiple nodes in a cluster. However, in this guide,
we use a `LOCAL` region so that you need not set up anything extra, such as an entire cluster of servers.

{apache-geode-name} is a key/value store, and a region implements the `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` interface. Though
you can treat a region as a `java.util.Map`, it is quite a bit more sophisticated than just a simple Java `Map`,
given that data is distributed, replicated, and generally managed inside the region.

In this example, you store `Person` objects in {apache-geode-name} (a region) by using only a few annotations.

`src/main/java/hello/Person.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Person.java[]
----

Here you have a `Person` class with two fields: `name` and `age`. You also have a single persistent constructor to
populate the entities when creating a new instance. The class uses https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok]
to simplify the implementation.

Notice that this class is annotated with `@Region("People")`. When {apache-geode-name} stores an instance of this class,
a new entry is created inside the `People` region. This class also marks the `name` field with `@Id`. This signifies
the identifier used to identify and track the `Person` data inside {apache-geode-name}.  Essentially, the `@Id` annotated
field (such as `name`) is the key, and the `Person` instance is the value in the key/value entry. There is no automated
key generation in {apache-geode-name}, so you must set the ID (the `name`) prior to persisting the entity to {apache-geode-name}.

The next important piece is the person's age. Later in this guide, we use it to fashion some queries.

The overridden `toString()` method prints out the person's name and age.

[[queries]]
== Create Simple Queries

Spring Data for {apache-geode-name} focuses on storing and accessing data in {apache-geode-name} using Spring. It also inherits
powerful functionality from the Spring Data Commons project, such as the ability to derive queries. Essentially, you
need not learn the query language of {apache-geode-name} (OQL). You can write a handful of methods,
and the framework writes the queries for you.

To see how this works, create an interface that queries `Person` objects stored in {apache-geode-name}:

`src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java[]
----

`PersonRepository` extends the `CrudRepository` interface from Spring Data Commons and specifies types for
the generic type parameters for both the value and the ID (key) with which the _Repository_ works (`Person`
and `String`, respectively). This interface comes with many operations, including basic CRUD
(create, read, update, delete) and simple query data access operations (such a `findById(..)`).

You can define other queries as needed by declaring their method signature. In this case, we add `findByName`,
which essentially searches for objects of type `Person` and finds one that matches on `name`.

You also have:

- `findByAgeGreaterThan`: To find people above a certain age
- `findByAgeLessThan`: To find people below a certain age
- `findByAgeGreaterThanAndAgeLessThan`: To find people in a certain age range

Let's wire this up and see what it looks like!

== Create an Application Class

The following example creates an application class with all the components:

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java,tabsize=2]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

In the configuration, you need to add the `@EnableGemfireRepositories` annotation.

* By default, `@EnableGemfireRepositories` scans the current package for any interfaces that extend one
of Spring Data's repository interfaces. You can use its `basePackageClasses = MyRepository.class` to safely tell
Spring Data for {apache-geode-name} to scan a different root package by type for application-specific _Repository_
extensions.

A {apache-geode-name} cache containing one or more regions is required to store all the data. For that, you use one
of Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}'s convenient configuration-based annotations: `@ClientCacheApplication`,
`@PeerCacheApplication`, or `@CacheServerApplication`.

{apache-geode-name} supports different cache topologies, such as client/server, peer-to-peer (p2p), and even WAN arrangements.
In p2p, a peer cache instance is embedded in the application, and your application would have the ability to participate
in a cluster as a peer cache member. However, your application is subject to all the constraints of being a peer member
in the cluster, so this is not as commonly used as, say, the client/server topology.

In our case, we use `@ClientCacheApplication` to create a "`client`" cache instance, which has the ability to
connect to and communicate with a cluster of servers. However, to keep things simple, the client stores
data locally by using a `LOCAL` client region, without the need to setup or run any servers.

Now, remember how you tagged `Person` to be stored in a region called `People` by using the SDG mapping annotation,
`@Region("People")`? You define that region here by using the `ClientRegionFactoryBean<String, Person>` bean definition.
You need to inject an instance of the cache you just defined while also naming it `People`.

NOTE: A {apache-geode-name} cache instance (whether a peer or client) is just a container for regions, which store your data.
You can think of the cache as a schema in an RDBMS and regions as the tables. However, a cache also performs other
administrative functions to control and manage all your Regions.

NOTE: The types are `<String, Person>`, matching the key type (`String`) with the value type (`Person`).

The `public static void main` method uses Spring Boot's `SpringApplication.run()` to launch the application
and invoke the `ApplicationRunner` (another bean definition) that performs the data access operations on {apache-geode-name}
using the application's Spring Data repository.

The application autowires an instance of `PersonRepository` that you just defined. Spring Data for {apache-geode-name}
dynamically creates a concrete class that implements this interface and plugs in the needed query code to meet
the interface's obligations. This repository instance is used by the `run()` method to demonstrate
the functionality.

== Store and fetch data

In this guide, you create three local `Person` objects: *Alice*, *Baby Bob*, and *Teen Carol*. Initially,
they only exist in memory. After creating them, you have to save them to {apache-geode-name}.

Now you can run several queries. The first looks up everyone by name. Then you can run a handful of queries to find adults,
babies, and teens, all by using the age attribute. With logging turned on, you can see the queries
Spring Data for {apache-geode-name} writes on your behalf.

TIP: To see the {apache-geode-name} OQL queries that are generated by SDG, change the `@ClientCacheApplication`
annotation `logLevel` attribute to `config`.
Because the query methods (such as `findByName`) are annotated with SDG's `@Trace`
annotation, this turns on {apache-geode-name}'s OQL query tracing (query-level logging), which shows you the generated OQL,
execution time, whether any {apache-geode-name} indexes were used by the query to gather the results, and the number of rows
returned by the query.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/main/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

You should see something like this (with other content, such as queries):

....
Before linking up with {apache-geode-name}...
	Alice is 40 years old.
	Baby Bob is 1 years old.
	Teen Carol is 13 years old.
Lookup each person by name...
	Alice is 40 years old.
	Baby Bob is 1 years old.
	Teen Carol is 13 years old.
Adults (over 18):
	Alice is 40 years old.
Babies (less than 5):
	Baby Bob is 1 years old.
Teens (between 12 and 20):
	Teen Carol is 13 years old.
....

== Summary

Congratulations! You set up an {apache-geode-name} cache client, stored simple entities, and developed quick queries.
