This guide walks you through the process of building an application with Pivotal GemFire's data fabric.

== What you'll build

You will use the powerful Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire library to store and retrieve link:/understanding/POJO[POJOs].

[[initial]]
== Define a simple entity

Pivotal GemFire is a _In-Memory Data Grid_ (IMDG) that maps data to Regions.  It is possible to configure
distributed Regions that partition and replicate data across multiple nodes in a cluster. However, in this guide,
you will be using a `LOCAL` Region so you don't have to set up anything extra, such as an entire cluster of servers.

Pivotal GemFire is a Key/Value store and a Region implements the `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap` interface.  Though
you can treat a Region like a `java.util.Map`, it is quite a bit more sophisticated than just a simple Java `Map`
given data is distributed, replicated and generally managed inside the Region.

In this example, you store `Person` objects in Pivotal GemFire (a Region) using only a few annotations.

`src/main/java/hello/Person.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Person.java[]
----

Here you have a `Person` class with two fields, `name` and `age`. You also have a single, persistent constructor to
populate the entities when creating a new instance. The class uses https://projectlombok.org/[Project Lombok]
to simplify the implementation.

Notice that this class is annotated with `@Region("People")`. When Pivotal GemFire stores an instance of this class,
a new entry is created inside the "People" Region. This class also marks the `name` field with `@Id`. This signifies
the identifier used to identify and track the `Person` data inside Pivotal GemFire.  Essentially, the `@Id` annotated
field (e.g. `name`) is the key and the `Person` instance is the value in the key/value entry.  There is no automated
key generation in Pivotal GemFire so you must set the id (i.e. `name`) prior to persisting the entity to Pivotal GemFire.

The next important piece is the person's age. Later in this guide, you will use it to fashion some queries.

The overridden `toString()` method will print out the person's name and age.

[[queries]]
== Create simple queries

_Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_ focuses on storing and accessing data in Pivotal GemFire using Spring. It also inherits
powerful functionality from the _Spring Data Commons_ project, such as the ability to derive queries. Essentially, you
don't have to learn the query language of Pivotal GemFire (OQL); you can simply write a handful of methods
and the queries are written for you by the framework.

To see how this works, create an interface that queries `Person` objects stored in Pivotal GemFire.

`src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/PersonRepository.java[]
----

`PersonRepository` extends the `CrudRepository` interface from _Spring Data Commons_ and specifies types for
the generic type parameters for both the value and the id (key) that the _Repository_ works with, i.e. `Person`
and `String`, respectively. Out-of-the-box, this interface comes with many operations, including basic CRUD
(CREATE, READ UPDATE, DELETE) and simple query (e.g. `findById(..)`) data access operations.

You can define other queries as needed by simply declaring their method signature. In this case, you add `findByName`,
which essentially searches for objects of type `Person` and finds one that matches on `name`.

You also have:

- `findByAgeGreaterThan` to find people above a certain age
- `findByAgeLessThan` to find people below a certain age
- `findByAgeGreaterThanAndAgeLessThan` to find people in a certain age range

Let's wire this up and see what it looks like!

== Create an application class
Here you create an Application class with all the components.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

In the configuration, you need to add the `@EnableGemfireRepositories` annotation.

* By default, `@EnableGemfireRepositories` will scan the current package for any interfaces that extend one
of Spring Data's _Repository_ interfaces. Use it's `basePackageClasses = MyRepository.class` to safely tell
_Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_ to scan a different root package by type for application-specific _Repository_
extensions.

A Pivotal GemFire cache containing 1 or more Regions is required to store all the data. For that, you use 1
of _Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire's_ convenient configuration-based annotations: `@ClientCacheApplication`,
`@PeerCacheApplication or `@CacheServerApplication`.

Pivotal GemFire supports different cache topologies like client/server, peer-to-peer (p2p) and even WAN arrangements.
In p2p, a peer cache instance is embedded in the application and your application would have the ability to participate
in a cluster as peer cache member.  However, your application is subject to all the constraints of being a peer member
in the cluster, so this is not as commonly used as, say, the client/server topology.

In our case, we will be using `@ClientCacheApplication` to create a "client" cache instance, which has the ability to
connect to and communicate with a cluster of servers.  However, to keep things simple, the client will just store
data locally using a `LOCAL`, client Region, without the need to setup or run any servers.

NOTE: Spring recommends the production, enterprise edition that is https://pivotal.io/pivotal-gemfire[Pivotal GemFire],
where you can create distributed caches and Regions across multiple nodes in cluster.  Alternatively, you can also use
the open source version, https://geode.apache.org/[Apache Geode], and get support from the Apache Geode community.

Now, remember how you tagged `Person` to be stored in a Region called "People" using the SDG mapping annotation,
`@Region("People")`? You define that Region here using the `ClientRegionFactoryBean<String, Person>` bean definition.
You need to inject an instance of the cache you just defined while also naming it "_People_".

NOTE: A Pivotal GemFire cache instance (whether a peer or client) is just a container for Regions, which store your data.
You can think of the cache as a schema in an RDBMS and Regions as the tables.  However, a cache also performs other
administrative functions to control and manage all your Regions.

NOTE: The types are `<String, Person>`, matching the key type (`String`) with the value type (`Person`).

The `public static void main` method uses _Spring Boot's_ `SpringApplication.run()` to launch the application
and invoke the `ApplicationRunner` (another bean definition) that performs the data access operations on Pivotal GemFire
using the application's _Spring Data_ _Repository_.

The application autowires an instance of `PersonRepository` that you just defined. _Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_
will dynamically create a concrete class that implements this interface and plug in the needed query code to meet
the interface's obligations. This _Repository_ instance is the used by the `run()` method to demonstrate
the functionality.

== Store and fetch data
In this guide, you are creating three local `Person` objects, **Alice**, **Baby Bob**, and **Teen Carol**. Initially,
they only exist in memory. After creating them, you have to save them to Pivotal GemFire.

Now you run several queries. The first looks up everyone by name. Then you execute a handful of queries to find adults,
babies, and teens, all using the age attribute. With the logging turned up, you can see the queries
_Spring Data for Pivotal GemFire_ writes on your behalf.

TIP: change the `@ClientCacheApplication` annotation `logLevel` attribute to "_config_" to see the Pivotal GemFire
OQL queries that are generated by SDG.  Because the query methods (e.g. `findByName`) are annotated with SDG's `@Trace`
annotation, this turns on Pivotal GemFire's OQL query tracing (query-level logging), which shows you the generated OQL,
execution time, whether any Pivotal GemFire Indexes were used by the query to gather the results, and the number of rows
returned by the query.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]

You should see something like this (with other stuff like queries as well):
....
Before linking up with GemFire...
	Alice is 40 years old.
	Baby Bob is 1 years old.
	Teen Carol is 13 years old.
Lookup each person by name...
	Alice is 40 years old.
	Baby Bob is 1 years old.
	Teen Carol is 13 years old.
Adults (over 18):
	Alice is 40 years old.
Babies (less than 5):
	Baby Bob is 1 years old.
Teens (between 12 and 20):
	Teen Carol is 13 years old.
....

== Summary
Congratulations! You set up an Pivotal GemFire cache client, stored simple entities, and developed quick queries.
